      "content": "# Sous Vide Chicken with Creamy Mushroom Rice Pilaf\n\nThis recipe combines perfectly tender sous vide chicken with a rich, creamy mushroom rice pilaf finished in a cast iron Dutch oven for exceptional flavor and texture.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n### For the Sous Vide Chicken:\n- 2 lbs chicken breast\n- Salt and pepper (or any seasoning blend you have)\n- 1-2 tablespoons oil or butter (optional, for searing)\n\n### For the Creamy Mushroom Rice Pilaf:\n- 1 cup basmati rice\n- 8 oz mushrooms, sliced\n- 1 cup heavy cream\n- 2 cups water or chicken broth (water works fine)\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n- 1-2 tablespoons oil or butter for cooking\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Prepare the Sous Vide Chicken:\n1. **Season the chicken** (30 minutes before cooking): Generously season chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Set up sous vide**: Fill a large pot or container with water and set your immersion circulator to **145°F (63°C)** for juicy, tender chicken.\n\n3. **Bag the chicken**: Place seasoned chicken breasts in a vacuum-seal bag or zip-lock bag. If using zip-lock, use the water displacement method to remove air.\n\n4. **Cook sous vide**: Submerge bag in water bath and cook for **2-3 hours**. The chicken will be perfectly cooked and can hold safely for up to 4 hours.\n\n### Prepare the Creamy Mushroom Rice Pilaf:\n5. **Start the rice** (about 45 minutes before chicken is done): Heat your cast iron Dutch oven over medium heat. Add oil or butter.\n\n6. **Sauté mushrooms**: Add sliced mushrooms to the Dutch oven and cook for **5-7 minutes** until golden brown and moisture has evaporated. Season with salt and pepper.\n\n7. **Toast the rice**: Add basmati rice to the mushrooms and stir for **2-3 minutes** until rice is lightly toasted and fragrant.\n\n8. **Add liquid**: Pour in 2 cups of water (or broth if you have it) and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for **15-18 minutes**.\n\n9. **Finish with cream**: Remove from heat and let stand **5 minutes**. Stir in heavy cream and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n### Finish and Serve:\n10. **Sear the chicken** (optional): Remove chicken from sous vide bag and pat dry. Heat a skillet over high heat with a little oil and sear chicken for **1-2 minutes per side** for color and texture.\n\n11. **Rest and slice**: Let chicken rest for **2-3 minutes**, then slice against the grain.\n\n12. **Plate**: Serve sliced chicken over the creamy mushroom rice pilaf.\n\n## Cooking Times Summary:\n- **Total time**: About 3 hours (mostly hands-off)\n- **Sous vide chicken**: 2-3 hours at 145°F\n- **Rice pilaf**: 30-35 minutes active cooking\n- **Optional searing**: 3-4 minutes\n\n## Missing Ingredient Substitutions:\n- **No oil/butter**: You can cook the mushrooms and rice in a dry pan, though they won't brown as nicely\n- **No salt/pepper**: Any dried herbs or spice blends you have will work\n- **No chicken broth**: Water works perfectly fine for the rice\n- **Want more flavor**: Any onion, garlic, or herbs you have on hand would be excellent additions\n\nThis recipe maximizes your specialized equipment while creating a restaurant-quality meal with minimal additional ingredients needed!",

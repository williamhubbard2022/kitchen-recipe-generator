      "content": "# Sous Vide Chicken with Creamy Mushroom Rice Pilaf\n\nThis recipe combines the precision of sous vide cooking with the rustic charm of cast iron cookery to create perfectly tender chicken alongside a luxurious mushroom rice pilaf.\n\n## Ingredients\n\n**For the Sous Vide Chicken:**\n- 2 lbs chicken breast\n- Salt and pepper (kitchen staple - if unavailable, chicken will still be delicious)\n- 2 tbsp olive oil or butter (optional, for searing)\n\n**For the Creamy Mushroom Rice Pilaf:**\n- 1 cup basmati rice\n- 8 oz mushrooms, sliced\n- 1 cup heavy cream\n- 2 cups water or chicken broth (water works fine if no broth available)\n- Salt and pepper to taste (optional)\n- 1 tbsp oil or butter for cooking (optional)\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Prepare the Sous Vide Chicken (Start First - 1.5 hours total)\n\n1. **Set up sous vide**: Fill a large pot or container with water and set your immersion circulator to 140°F (60°C) for juicy, tender chicken.\n\n2. **Season chicken**: Pat chicken breasts dry and season with salt and pepper if available. Place in a vacuum-seal bag or zip-top bag, removing as much air as possible using the water displacement method.\n\n3. **Cook sous vide**: Submerge sealed chicken in the water bath and cook for 1 to 1.5 hours.\n\n### Prepare the Mushroom Rice Pilaf (Start 45 minutes before chicken is done)\n\n4. **Preheat Dutch oven**: Place your cast iron Dutch oven over medium heat.\n\n5. **Sauté mushrooms**: Add sliced mushrooms to the dry Dutch oven (or with a little oil if available). Cook for 5-7 minutes until mushrooms release their moisture and begin to brown.\n\n6. **Add rice**: Add the basmati rice to the mushrooms and stir for 1-2 minutes to lightly toast the rice.\n\n7. **Add liquid**: Pour in 2 cups of water (or broth if available) and bring to a boil.\n\n8. **Simmer**: Reduce heat to low, cover with the Dutch oven lid, and simmer for 15-18 minutes until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.\n\n9. **Add cream**: Remove from heat and stir in the heavy cream. Let stand covered for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork. Season with salt and pepper if available.\n\n### Finish the Chicken\n\n10. **Remove and sear** (optional): Remove chicken from sous vide bath. For added color and texture, quickly sear in a hot skillet with oil or butter for 1-2 minutes per side.\n\n11. **Rest and slice**: Let chicken rest for 2-3 minutes, then slice against the grain.\n\n### Serve\n\n12. **Plate**: Serve sliced chicken over the creamy mushroom rice pilaf.\n\n## Cooking Times & Temperatures\n- **Sous vide chicken**: 140°F for 1-1.5 hours\n- **Rice pilaf**: 15-18 minutes simmering + 5 minutes resting\n- **Total active time**: 30 minutes\n- **Total time**: 1 hour 45 minutes\n\n## Notes & Substitutions\n- **Missing salt/pepper**: The dish will still be flavorful from the mushrooms and cream\n- **No oil for searing**: Skip the searing step - sous vide chicken is perfectly tender without it\n- **No broth**: Water works perfectly fine for the rice\n- **Cream substitute**: If you need to stretch the cream, you can thin it with a little of the cooking liquid from the rice\n\nThis recipe showcases both pieces of your specialized equipment while creating a restaurant-quality meal with minimal additional ingredients needed!",
